  <p>I am a historian of South Asia and British imperialism. I study mass deaths in cities such as Bombay, Calcutta and London to argue how imperialism has transformed the practice of death disposals and destitution. The broad theme of death and dying does not merely allow us to bring sharp focus onto an understudied subject in South Asia, but also provide us with method to grasp the everyday scales of imperialism. </p>
