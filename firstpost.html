  <p>This project owes more to my students, friends and colleagues in school and higher education than I can formally acknowledge. If some are named, many more remain unnamed. I learnt from interactions and workshops in schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions. My gratitude to all those who shared this journey, and made me part of theirs. These include, in particular, my friends and colleagues in Eklavya, whose exemplary commitment and perseverance in engaging with issues of pedagogy in complex and challenging contexts served as a constant reminder of possibilities and pitfalls. I have also benefited from countless conversations running through email and social network groups—sometimes contentious and even acrimonious, but also illuminating and stimulating. And thanks to Janaki Rajan and Narayani Gupta, who led me into the intricacies of the world of school textbooks several years ago. 
Many of my students spared time, energy, enthusiasm and insights in long conversations. We created space for these discussions collectively. I derived strength, sustenance, and much more from these engagements, especially at moments when my own energy tended to flag. This project relied on their excitement, encouragement and enthusiasm, even as it may not always live up to their expectations. Thanks in particular to Abhijeet, Chandrabhan, Poonam, Preeti, Sarvjeet, and to Aishwarya, Anjali, Anjani, Anwesha, Banita, Divvya, Hrushikesh, Parul, Poonam, Pratichi, Preeti, Rohit, Sene, Shreyasee, and Yash, as well as to my classmates, Farah, Kandala, Kenza, Pankhuri, Paridhi, and Sara. Srabani provided part of the title for one of the chapters in the course of a casual and typically illuminating conversation. Others, who began as students and became friends and colleagues over the years, offered support—thanks in particular to Kavita Gaur for her consistent support through a critical stage of the project, and to Snigdha Singh. 
Friends and colleagues, some curious, others sceptical, yet others compelling me to rethink, rephrase, rework many ideas, have been a constant reminder of the collaborative process of teaching, learning and researching, and the possibilities of responding creatively to challenges. Some found time to read and comment on the half-baked drafts of chapters with which I routinely clogged their email inboxes, others relentlessly  and sternly reminded me of the need to step outside my comfort zone, yet others offered tea, sympathy, company, and opportunities to discuss my work, all of which I treasure. Thanks in particular to G. Arunima, Bharati Sud, Indivar Kamtekar, Janaki Nair, Joy Pachuau, Kanchana Natarajan, Kunal Chakrabarti, R. Mahalakshmi, Neeladri Bhattacharya, Rekha Basu and Supriya Varma.  I am also grateful to Mallarika Sinha Roy, who generously created space for me to audit her course on ethnography, which yielded insights, questions, and the unique experience of being in a classroom without being burdened with any responsibilities. Krishna Kumar and Romila Thapar kept a watchful eye on this project as it developed, nurturing, encouraging, and trying to keep it on track, as I tended to wander along the myriad strands of the web of our educational universe. Krishna Kumar, in particular, ploughed through the entire first draft with kindness and care, offering detailed critical comments and invaluable suggestions. I am not sure how far I have been able to respond to these, but I cherish the intervention.  
Institutional support was crucial. I would like to thank my colleagues and the administration of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi for enabling me to avail of leave to pursue this project, and the Director, administrative and technical staff at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi, who ensured that the period I spent there (December 2014 to November 2016)  as a senior fellow was fruitful and fulfilling, meeting requests for support promptly and efficiently.  I benefited in particular from the opportunity to listen to excellent speakers on a wide range of themes at seminars and conferences.  Many of these, especially on environmental and social issues, in both English and Hindi, were often stimulating and thought-provoking. That they were also available to mull over as ‘Occasional Papers’ was an added advantage. The opportunity to present papers during the fellowship was invaluable, and I benefited from the ensuing discussion, as well as from interactions with fellows, past and present. 
I benefited immensely from the support of Veena Sachdev, Anshu Dogra, Maya, Trishna, Bihari Lal Verma and the children and young adults at Manana, New Delhi, who provided me with space, ideas, and opportunities to think through and work on the project during its initial stages. Thanks also to those who invited me to participate in orientation programmes and provided an opportunity to engage in discussions with the participants—these include Indrani Mazumdar of the Centre for Women and Development Studies, New Delhi, Vijayalaxmi Singh of the Centre for Professional Development in Higher Education, Delhi University, and Suresh Singh, Principal, Kendriya Vidyalaya, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi. Bhupendra Yadav, Jaya Menon and Sadhna Saxena provided me with opportunities to present some of my ideas to a wider audience, as did Kalpana Kannabiran and Padmini Swaminathan (Roy 2017a) and the editorial board of Contemporary Education Dialogue (Roy 2017b).  Shikha Sen provided me with a unique opportunity to observe and participate in an extremely interesting attempt to make history come alive for a group of young learners. I am especially grateful to Amman Madan, S. Gunasekaran, Ranjeeta Dutta, Satish Deshpande and Shonaleeka Kaul for discussing parts of the draft with empathy and insight at a workshop organized by Ch. Radha Gayathri under the auspices of the Educational Records and Research Unit, Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi in February 2017. 
I have been acutely aware of my dependence on those who share with me the myriad tasks that go into the working of the household from which I derive support. Their presence or absence made a difference almost every day. My gratitude to Ganesh, Jhuma Das, Lakkhan Karan, Rina Ari, Rohit Kanojia, Sabita, Santosh Ari, Sharad Pandey, Tulshi Pradhan, and Wilson Pereira. And, as always, this project would not have reached fruition without constant and consistent encouragement from my mother, Shanta Basu (who remains an absent presence), and the affection extended by Sumanto, Asha, Durga and Sabyasachi. 
As I decided to try and finalize the manuscript in the midst of a pandemic, Smriti Vohra, friend, thinker and creative potter, generously agreed to provide the visuals for the cover, her visualization of Punna, literally the full or complete one, a theri from the Therigatha, a unique Buddhist text, sharing her moment of enlightenment as she parts the curtains to reveal the full moon, and Patachara, a remarkable woman who overcame grief in order to support and nurture others (Roy 2015). Equally generous and prompt was the response of S. Gunasekaran, friend and colleague, and innovative designer of countless posters for seminars organized by the Centre for Historical Studies, who promptly agreed to design the cover of this virtual book at very short notice and under extraordinary circumstances, with the support of his friend and colleague, Ahilan Packiyanathan, University of Jaffna, currently at the School of Arts and Aesthetics, JNU. Thanks also to Krishn, Ujjwal and others for patient, thoughtful and sometimes amazingly cheerful and irreverent responses to long, meandering emails, a welcome relief from often panic-stricken rapid-fire whatsapp messages that have been the more typical mode of communication during the lockdown. And the indefatigable Uma Chakravarti, who, through long, intense, telephonic conversations, insisted that there would be worlds beyond the pandemic. Hopefully, some of what is in this book will be of use in those worlds. 
Some of us have been talking about democratization, decommodification and remediation as a long-term response to our current global crises. As a small step towards decommodification, I thought it would be a good idea to circulate this book through email to those who might be interested in reading it. You, in turn, are welcome to forward it to others if you wish. This is therefore, a book that is not routed through the publishing industry. For what it is worth, it is meant to circulate freely. To all those who have the patience to read, grateful thanks. All feedback is welcome at kumkumr@yahoo.com, even as I may not always be able to respond. Those of you who wish to translate parts into any regional language are welcome to do so. 
Inevitably, shortcomings remain. However, if the ideas and issues raised in this book stimulate further debate. dialogue and discussion, it will have served its purpose.
