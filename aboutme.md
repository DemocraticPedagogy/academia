My name is Sohini Chattopadhyay. 

Sohini Chattopadhyay is a doctoral student in the department of History at Columbia University. She has an undergraduate degree in History from Presidency College, Kolkata, and an M.A. from the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Her research interests focus on connections between comparative urbanisms, public health histories, and ideas of “the body” in imperial and international organizations. In her PhD thesis which is tentatively titled “The unclaimed dead body as an urban problem in Calcutta and Bombay, 1896 – 1950”, she traces how catastrophic mortality of the bubonic plague in Bombay transformed the ways in which colonial urban governance disposed of the dead bodies of those who did not have families to support their rituals. She studies the moment of plague to enter into an archive of debates around technologies of death such as crematoria machines, zinc shrouds, mass cremations; and traces how this produced enduring urban legacies right after decolonization in 1947, evidenced through a series of laws on how to dispose of the unclaimed dead. By studying how local histories of Calcutta and Bombay addressed and treated the subaltern corpses differently, she argues how the identities and technologies of managing the corpse were often mediated by local politics, and humanitarian concerns with global relevance which did not necessarily spread evenly across British India. Together, this work intervenes in the historical works on “mass death” caused by the two World Wars, in order to highlight the longer history of the colonial state in creating new forms of mass deaths and disposals.
