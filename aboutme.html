title: About me
---
I am Sohini, a historian, amateur cartoonist, and fascinated by all things urban. 

I am a PhD Candidate at the History Department, Columbia University. I specialize in History of Science, South Asian History, Global Health, and British Imperial History. My research seeks to know why India became the world's largest anatomical product supplier till 1980s. My research has taken me to small alleys of Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai, religious institutions, municipal authorities, imperial records and medical college libraries. I frame my research around the intersections between colonial political economy, mortality and morbidity to argue that the history of scientific products such as anatomical objects must begin with an investigation of health, urbanization and imperial political economy.

I do not think of history as an academic course, but a personal quest that embroils and questions my own identity as a researcher. I intend to write here more on that soon!
